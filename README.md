Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
- by ensuring the software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 

1. Change in requirement with time
2. Environment change
3. Security risks

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning -  identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
2. Requirement Analysis - identify the final user specification. 
3. Design -  building the framework
4. Coding/Bulding - converting software design into tangible code.
5. Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
6. Deployment - involves rolling out the tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
7. Maintainance - constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Agile - breaks work into iterative steps, which are smaller tasks that can be completed quickly
 - High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
 - Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
 - Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

3. Waterfall -  follows a linear sequence of events and each phase of the project is gated , Teams cannot advance from one phase to the next until the current phase is 
 complete
 -there is Low flexibility,
 -changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
 - collaborating with other teams
 
3. Quality Assurance Engineer -  collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 -confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
 -tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.

5. Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - Budget and resource allocation
 - Progress monitoring and reporting
 - Contributing to overall project objectives

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Itegrated Development Environment (IDE) -  It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in 
 an easy-to-use application.
 -an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
 -IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of 
 regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out
 -Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically 
 writing or editing the source code.

3. Version Control Systems (VCS) - helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications
   -it also protects the source code from any unintended human error and consequences.
   -Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
   Example - GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1.Rapid Technological Advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Strategy: by adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
 
2.Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Strategy: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
 
3. Software Security - is a complex and challenging task in part because cybercriminals can exploit many different types of vulnerabilities
 Strategy: by actively researching ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats, and more.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing -  low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules 
 used by your software.
-it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
- Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server
  .
3. Integration testing - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 -These types of tests are more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.
 -help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 
4. System Testing - Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

5. Acceptance Testing - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and 
 focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- they can also go further and measure the performance of the system and reject changes if certain goals are not met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering  is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs
-Even though generative AI attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output.
-it is the bridge ensuring effective human-AI communication

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
